# ChatGPT API

Hey there! I'm Ali, a new developer embarking on my coding journey. Fresh off graduating from a fullstack coding bootcamp, I've been diving into the fascinating world of AI. As part of my learning journey, I've created a small, single-purpose AI application that taps into the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Behind the scenes, this app makes API calls to ChatGPT, allowing users to interact with an AI chatbot.

I initially started by following along with YouTube tutorials, but my goal is to add my own unique touch and expand the capabilities of the app once I've laid down the foundational code. I'm thrilled to explore the vast potential of AI and continue learning along the way. Join me on this exciting journey!
